# Connect-Four
Connect Four using the Java console

To play simply compile this in a java compiler (preferably eclipse) and run it (use the console to type coordinates [1-7]). Sorry for the spaghetti code, but this was written in my sophomore year of high school. Also this was built for only two players. Also feel free to view any other projects I made.
